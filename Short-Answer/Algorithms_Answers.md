#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b) O(nlog2n)


c) O(n^2)

## Exercise II

    # If there are no floor, then no trial 
    # needed. OR if there is one floor, one 
    # trial needed. 
    if (n == 1 or n == 0): 
        return n 

    # If there are more than 1 floor, drops egg at mid point to determine whether floor f is in the upper half or lower half 
    # This is a binary search problem O(log n)
